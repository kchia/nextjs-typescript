/*
You do not need to worry about .error {} colliding with any other `.css` or
`.module.css` files!

Next.js supports CSS Modules using the [name].module.css file naming convention.

Regular <link> stylesheets and global CSS files are still supported. CSS modules is optional

In production, all CSS Module files will be automatically concatenated into 
many minified and code-split .css files.

These .css files represent hot execution paths in your application, 
ensuring the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for your application to paint.

It's also possible to use any existing CSS-in-JS solution, there's support for sass/scss
